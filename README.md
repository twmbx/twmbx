## Hi 🖖🏿
I'm Twaambo, a Zambian software developer.<br><br>
👨🏿‍💻 I develop for the full stack, I have preferences for languages and frameworks but love learning and adapting to new things.<br>
🤖 I've embraced agentic AI workflows and use the Gemini and Claude CLIs liberally.<br>
💼 I work remotely on projects in multiple verticals. I build eCommerce using Shopify, WooCommerce as well as React Router, C# .Net Core and Laravel for integrations and other applications.<br><br>
🤩 I'm excited about solving problems around digital commerce for the African context with Zambia as my current focus.<br><br>
🇿🇲 Are you looking for other Zambian developers and interested in seeing some OSS stuff that Zambian developers have been working on? Have a look at [Made In Zambia](https://github.com/ZambianTech/made-in-zambia).<br>
