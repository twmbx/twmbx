## Hi 🖖🏿
I'm Twaambo, a Zambian software developer.

💼 At the moment I am working remotely on PHP eCommerce products as well as running [Mvesesani](https://about.mvesesani.com).<br>
⚗️ I've recently been experimenting & tinkering with Go for back end server & command line tools, Dart & Flutter for cross platform mobile development and recently C# with dotNet Core for cross platform command line tools as well as desktop tools using Electron.Net.<br>
🤩 I'm excited about solving problems around digital commerce for the African context with Zambia as my current focus.<br>
🇿🇲 Are you looking for other Zambian developers? Check out [Zambian.dev](https://zambian.dev)<br>
🛠️ Interested in seeing some OSS stuff that Zambian developers have been working on? Have a look at [Made In Zambia](https://github.com/ZambianTech/made-in-zambia).<br>
