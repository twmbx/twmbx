## Hi 🖖🏿
I'm Twaambo, a Zambian software developer.<br><br>
👨🏿‍💻 I develop for the full stack with a leaning towards the back end with my preferred language to use being PHP.<br>
💼 I'm currently working remotely on eCommerce projects using Shopify, WooCommerce as well as Laravel and C# .Net Core for integrations and other applications. In addition to that I am also part of the team that run [Mvesesani](https://mvesesani.com).<br><br>
🤩 I'm excited about solving problems around digital commerce for the African context with Zambia as my current focus.<br><br>
🇿🇲 Are you looking for other Zambian developers and interested in seeing some OSS stuff that Zambian developers have been working on? Have a look at [Made In Zambia](https://github.com/ZambianTech/made-in-zambia).<br>
