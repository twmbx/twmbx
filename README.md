## Hi 🖖🏿
I'm Twaambo, a Zambian software developer.<br><br>
👨🏿‍💻 I develop for the full stack with a leaning towards the back end with my preferred language to use being PHP.<br>
💼 Most recently I've worked remotely on PHP eCommerce products in addition to running [Mvesesani](https://about.mvesesani.com).<br><br>
⚗️ I've recently been experimenting & tinkering with Go for back end server & command line tools as well as Dart because, Flutter.<br><br>
🤩 I'm excited about solving problems around digital commerce for the African context with Zambia as my current focus.<br><br>
